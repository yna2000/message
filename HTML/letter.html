Here’s a sweet and thoughtful letter for your crush, Gab, that reflects your CODM connection:

Dear Gab,

I hope this letter surprises you in the best way possible. I don’t even know where to start because just thinking about you brings a smile to my face. We may have met through the world of CODM, but honestly, you’ve been the best “drop” I could have ever hoped for.

Every time we team up, whether we’re taking down enemies or reviving each other, I feel like we make the perfect duo. You’re not just amazing in the game—you’ve got this vibe that makes every moment feel special. It’s like you’re the MVP of both CODM and my thoughts.

What I really want to say is that you’re someone I’ve grown to admire more and more, not just for your skills, but for the kind, fun, and genuine person you are. If this were a battle royale, I’d go all in just to keep you close.

I don’t know where this will go, but I’d love to get to know you better—both in-game and in real life. Maybe one day, we could have a “mission” that doesn’t require a headset. Until then, just know that I think you’re awesome, Gab.

Take care, and see you on the battlefield!
